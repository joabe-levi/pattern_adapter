Government Spreadsheet Import Project

This project was developed to streamline the import and analysis of two spreadsheets provided by the government: one containing a catalog of materials and another containing information about services. The goal is to create a flexible and efficient solution capable of handling different spreadsheet formats and extracting relevant data for further analysis.

The import process is simplified through dynamic method creation at runtime. For each row in the spreadsheets, custom parsers are created that extract and organize the pertinent information. These parsers are then added to a list, enabling easy iteration and processing of each entry in the datasets.

With this approach, the project offers an agile and automated way to deal with the complexities of government spreadsheets, providing users with an effective means to access and utilize the data contained within them.
